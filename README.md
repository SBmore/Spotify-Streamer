# Spotify Streamer

Project 1 from the Android Developer Nanodegree. An android app that lets you search for artists, see their top 10 tracks and then play them using the Spotify API. This project was completed in two stages; the first two screens were implemented in Stage 1, and the track player was implemented in Stage 2.

This project will utilises two key Android libraries, which were included to reduce unnecessary extra work to help focus on applying the learned app development skills.

* Picasso - A powerful library that will handle image loading and caching on your behalf.
* Spotify-Web-Api-Wrapper - A clever Java wrapper for the Spotify Web API that provides java methods that map directly to Web API endpoints. In other words, this wrapper handles making the HTTP request to a desired API endpoint, and deserializes the JSON response so you donâ€™t need to write any parsing code by hand. When you need to make a particular Web API call, you simply call the corresponding method in the library and act on the return data, already converted to Java objects that you can interact with programmatically.
